# Tree of directories
The Source is implemented as a Shared Library (DLL on Windows). The Source will not run stand-alone.

The Source Manager recursively searches for all Sources in the TWAIN sub-directory. To reduce the chance for naming collisions, each Source should create a sub-directory beneath TWAIN, giving it a name relevant to their product.

For correct work of the Saraff.Twain.DS you must place the files as follows:
* **C:\windows\twain_{32/64}\\** - TWAIN directory
	* **Data Source directory** - sub-directory beneath TWAIN (preferably used GUID)
		* Saraff.Twain.DS_{x86/x64}.ds - Entry Point of a Data Source
		* Your assembly of Data Source and dependents of Data Source
* **GAC**
	* **Saraff.Twain.DS** - must be installed to GAC
